BetterBlockBreaking Reborn
===================
This is an updated version of BetterBlockBreaking for 1.16+.

It has also been updated to use Gradle 7.0.2, which also means support for Java 16 in the future.

Performance of the code has also been improved and cleaned up (also put in separate packages).
